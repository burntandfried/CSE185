# CSE185-BWA-porject

This is the project for CSE185, done by Jade Chng, Ananya Prasad and Anna-Sophia Dinov. It implements the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner method using Burrows-Wheeler Trans

 This program is a rudimentary attempt to implement the BWA tool we used in Lab, thus, we will be comparing our program to the BWA tool. We plan on coding and running the tool in Python.
