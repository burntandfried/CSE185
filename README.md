# CSE185-BWA-project
This is the project for CSE185, done by Jade Chng, Ananya Prasad and Anna-Sophia Dinov. It implements a Burrows-Wheeler Transfrom to index the reference genome and then performs Burrows Wheeler Alignment to align reads to the genome. 

# Install Instructions

# Basic Usage Instructions 
'python myBwa.py <genome fasta> <reads fastq>'

# File format 
Genome file: A fasta file with the first line being a header line followed by a single string that represents the database to be queried on the next line.\
Query file: A fastq file where lines with the query sequence are a single string (no new line or space characters)
